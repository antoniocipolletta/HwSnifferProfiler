WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   Fault_Checker_subsystem/tc_s is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   135 out of  11,640    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          328
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            81 out of     328   24%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              29 out of  93,120    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
